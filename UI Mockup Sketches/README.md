# UI Mockup

## Flowchart
User Dashboard and Admin are only accessible with corresponding log in

## HomePage
Shows Categories not onlike 'Tutti' for example
already shows list of products
simple search at cetegorisation possible
'login' switches to 'logout' and 'register' disappears when logged in

## Login
From Login you can also access registration, in case you realize you're not a user yet.
Once logged in the user immediately returns to the homepage, he'll see a button 'dashboard' ( eventually it will be called otherwise) with which he can access his own user-page/dashboard, and edit his settings/ products

## Register
There will be drop down lists for some of the fields
some fields will be optional, others required for registration

## User Dashboard
user can see his past transactions, products sold/bought, and access details of the transaction
user can add/remove a product/service
user can edit his settings/ adress/ number/ picture

## Search
it will be possible to search by diverse criteria and to sort by others

## Product Detail
contains picture, written description, price for selling and/or price for renting / hiring
contains location 
contains description of user that is seling and eventually comments of other users/buyers

## Admin 
has the same view as a normal user, but in his dashboard he can also access a list of users he can make admin or delete and a list of products which he can admit for display or denie ( eventually with a comment to the user proposing the product)

## Logo
will be always in the left corner (and maybe act as a home - button )
the two images are only first drafts
